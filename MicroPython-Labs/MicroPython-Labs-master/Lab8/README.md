## Lab8 - Pico PONG 

In this lab we can bring it all together joystick, display, sound and play Pong.  The 2 player game is not very good as a 1 player so work in groups to make BREAKOUT a better PONG for 1 player. 

--- 

Install and play the pong.py game it should work with the joystick up and down options. 

The problem here is that its a 2 player game for a 1 player device, and I doubt most folks have had to do much thinking or coding in MicroPython.  So this lab is to work either alone or in groups, and. make Breakout rather than Pong.  The Pong code should have all the code needed for moving the paddles and detecting a bounce,  and I have provided links to a much more sophisticated Python break out game for reference.   

GOOD LUCK - Happy coding.
